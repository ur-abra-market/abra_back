# Getting started

## **Backend**

**Step 0:** Requirements

In our project we use: GIT, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/), Python 3.10.

If you use Windows — WSL 2 should be **[installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)**.

Also needed:

1. Make tool

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt-get -y install make
    ```

     For Windows users

     Install chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install). Then run:

    ```bash
    choco install make
    ```


**Step 1**: Clone the backend project repository. Notice that we are currently developing at arch/refactoring branch.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fouinyla/wb_platform_back.git
cd wb_platform_back
git switch arch/refactoring
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Step 2:** Build and Run the Docker Container

2.1. Copy .env file to the root of the project folder (you can find .env in our chat, just look for the latest “#env #backend”).

2.2. To start the project in Docker run:

```bash
make build
make migrations
make up
```

2.3 To run the project locally:

```python
	python3 app/main.py
```

2.4 You can find OpenAPI schema at [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)

**Step 3:** Understand the architecture

3.1 You might be overwhelmed by the amount of custom elements in the project. But let me reassure you that it’s quite easy to use once you get the gist.

3.2 SQLAlchemy models are defined at app/orm/core. Notice that a lot of commonly used types are already defined: bool_true, decimal_10_2, moscow_datetime_timezone. Feel free to add new.

3.3  Look at app/core/app/crud/__init__.py. It’s where main class for CRUD operations is defined:

```python
class _CRUD:
    admins: CRUD[AdminModel] = CRUD(AdminModel)
    categories: CRUD[CategoryModel] = CRUD(CategoryModel)
		companies: CRUD[CompanyModel] = CRUD(CompanyModel)
		...
```

As you can see it contains all models. What is more it provides interface for all base SQL operations. You can find them at app/core/app/crud/operations. It’s possible to do joins, grouping, ordering etc. just by passing args to functions:

```python
from core.orm import orm

await orm.products.get_many_unique(
	session=session,
  where=[
		ProductModel.is_active.is_(True),
    ProductModel.category_id == filters.category_id if filters.category_id else None,
  ],
  options=[
    joinedload(ProductModel.prices),
    joinedload(ProductModel.images),
    joinedload(ProductModel.supplier).joinedload(SupplierModel.user),
  ],
  offset=pagination.offset,
  limit=pagination.limit,
  order_by=filters.get_order_by(),
)
```

3.4  We try to keep our code as much typed as possible. All inputs and outputs of any endpoint must be typed. You can find schemas at app/schemas. Feel free to add new schemas but examine existing ones first.

3.5 All common functions (auth, session, AWS interfaces) are kept at app/core/depends. Before writing new piece of code make sure it has not been written yet ;)

********************Step 4:******************** Develop!

4.1 We use a bunch of code analysers. You can find full list at .pre-commit-config.yaml. They run automatically on every commit. Please notice that some of them (black, isort) can modify your code. If it is the case please run git add [filename] again on the files that were changed.

 
# Code style (still in development)


## Type annotations

- must be annotated: function arguments, variables, return values
- orm classes must be mapped with annotated python types

## Routers

- camel case
- slash at the end of route
- define named parameters
- write summary
- define request model(s)
- define response model with ApplicationResponse
- define status code

## Imports

- divide lib imports from python package imports
- avoid importing everything from package with asterisks
- all modules must be imported in __init__ files
- don't repeat libraries while importing
- remove unused imports before commit



Please let us know if we should add something to this page!

Good luck, have fun:)
